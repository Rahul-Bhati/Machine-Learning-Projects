# Analyzing Movie Reviews
This project is inspired by popular blog post of [FiveThirtyEight](http://fivethirtyeight.com). The dataset is stored in the fandango_score_comparison.csv file. It contains information on how major movie review services rated movies. The data originally came from [FiveThirtyEight Dataset](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/fandango). In this project I have performed statistical analysis on **Metacritic_norm_round** - The Metacritic critic score for the film, normalized to a 0 to 5 point system and rounded to the nearest half-star and **Fandango_Stars** - The number of stars the film had on its Fandango movie page.
