# Winning Jeopardy
Jeopardy is a popular TV show in the US where participants answer questions to win money. The dataset is named jeopardy.csv, and contains 20000 rows from the beginning of a full dataset of Jeopardy questions, which you can download [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/1uyd0t/200000_jeopardy_questions_in_a_json_file/). In this project, I have tried to answer below-mentioned questions using statistics:
* How often the answer is deducible from the question.
* How often new questions are repeats of older questions.
